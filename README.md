These are projects that, while I have decided to place on the backburner to work on other projects, still have some merit worth showcasing. They are typically left behind because of either a lapse in interest on my end or because I would need more experience on specific aspects of their development before I could entertain the idea of releasing them, commercially or otherwise. 

However, it is still my intention to revisit them at some point. In the meantime, I try to work on things that have some connection to these projects so that I might build the required experience and confidence necessary. Note that there is no code publically available for any of these projects - I was supposed to sell them after all. Feel free to ask though. I'll probably say yes.
